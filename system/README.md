# University Matching Program for Turkish Students

This programme aims to output a list of bachelors degree engineering studies in the Netherlands for Turkish high school students based on their diploma, subject choices, grades, english level and preferences. 

## Project description
The admission requirements change for each study programme and university. Therefore, the process of finding a study programme that matches a student's qualities, and preferences is difficult to research, and takes a lot of time. In consultation with the CEO’s of a consulting company, ‘Bluedot’ found in Turkey, which  guides students in the process of choosing and applying for a university programme in the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK) and the Netherlands, we have build this programme with the hopes of facilitating the university matching process for both the experts and the students/clients.


## How to Install and Run the Program

In order to run the program, you need to install python and the tkinter package. The tkinter package can be installed using pip. 

### Installing

First make sure, python and pip are installed and up-to-date. For the program, we used python version `3.10.0` and the tkinter package version `8.6`. For installing the tkinter package, we used pip version `21.3.1` of pip. 

When you have the correct versions of python and pip installed, you can install the tkinter package by typing one of the following commands in your terminal:

For windows:

``` pip install tk ```

For MACOS:

``` pip3 install tk ```
